## Introduction

üë®‚Äçüéì Fellow students, working professionals, and tech enthusiasts:

Thank you for downloading this study bundle. Compiled from a variety of sources, these resources have been put together to assist in studying for the A+ exam in early 2017. This mix includes my own paid resources as well as free materials gathered from different torrents and websites.

üëâ **Study Path Recommendation:**

1. **CBT Nuggets Series**: A quick recap for familiar material.
2. **Professor Messer Videos**: Deep dive into challenging or new topics.
3. **Mike Meyers eBook**: Utilize the chapter quizzes to test your knowledge on tough subjects.
4. **Practice Test Application (Microsoft Press)**: Offers valuable practice, though be aware of outdated questions.
5. **Professor Messer Study Guides**: Best saved for final review due to a format that favors memorization over comprehension.
